You I'm going to start writing those set of instructions that would get you
started that I mentioned this one time. I want you to know that you ask me any
question you have at anypoint. I also need this done for myself so you helping
me will not only show you what you need to know in python and aid me in
completing this.

### Step 1: Acquire a github account. 
This account will aid us in version control collaboration. (version control:
you have a peace of work (code/script) and it exists in that current version.
If you were to update or change any part of the work, it will no longer be
the previous version, it's the new version. 

Everytime we move to new versions of the code, the best practice is to
document what has changed between versions. This is possible to do using a
version control system like, [git](https://git-scm.com/). I'm trying to slowly
talk more and more about what we can do with this tool as we go on.

Sign up on the official [GitHub website](https://github.com/).


### Step 2: Get this code on your computer.
Time to get you a hold of the code that you're going to have to be making
changes to. You're currently looking at this code through a repository hosted
remotely on GitHub servers. Through the use of the version control system, git,
we can interact with this repository, push and pulling any changes. 

#### Download [git](https://git-scm.com/).
